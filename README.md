## About
If you ever wanted to use a static html template for your react app, I present a proven way to do so. By breaking down a huge HTML file to managable react components that you can reuse
- https://static-html-to-react-1xif84npb.vercel.app/

## Note Worthyüìê
- Where to place your styling ? Import all styling in the app.js
- Where to place the assets (css, fonts, js, images) folder ? Inside the src folder - this way you won't have to import the styling on each component
- Removing all default html comments
- Html class attributes should be converted to className (class is a keyword in javascript and JSX is an extension of javascript. That's the principal reason why React uses className instead of class.)
- Use camelCases 
- All html elements to be used inside a component should have closing tags
- Importing images using src ={imageName} - refer to ( https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-images-fonts-and-files/)

## Project StructureüöÄ
The structure of the web app

- assets- all common scripts and stylings (css), fonts used on the pages, theme scripts included in script.js file
- src - all jsx files
- components - all react components

## Hosting
- Vercel - continous delivery/ Automatically deploys app each time you commit to the master branch
- Heroku - great option but slow
